# Zarcula for Zed

Zarcula is a dark theme for the [Zed editor](https://zed.dev) inspired by JetBrains Darcula – but tuned specifically for Zed’s UI, terminal, and collaborative editing experience.


## Features

Darcula’s sophisticated cousin, custom-built for Zed.


- **Cohesive UI**  
  Carefully matched backgrounds and borders for:
  - Editor and gutter
  - Panels and toolbars
  - Tabs, status bar, and title bar

- **Readable syntax colors**
  - Keywords & booleans: `#CC7832` (warm orange)
  - Strings & labels: `#6A8759` (muted green)
  - Numbers & numeric-like values: `#6897BB` (blue)
  - Functions: `#FFC66D` (soft yellow)
  - Types & selectors: `#8888C6` (violet)
  - Comments: `#808080` (neutral gray)
  - Doc comments: `#6A8759` (green, to stand out from regular comments)

- **Integrated terminal styling**
  - Dedicated ANSI palette matching the editor colors
  - Tuned normal, bright, and dim colors for long shell sessions

- **Rich diagnostics colors**
  - Error / warning / info / hint / success
  - created / modified / deleted / renamed
